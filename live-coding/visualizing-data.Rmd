For this activity, we will practice making different visualizations for the `penguins` data set from the **palmerpenguins** package. Let's load the packages in our interactive environment by running the following code chunk.

```{r load-packages}
library(ggplot2)                   #for making graphs
library(palmerpenguins)            #for the data
```

Now that the packages are loaded, take a look at the data `penguins` to get a good feel for it. You can do this in one of two ways:
  - Type `penguins` at the prompt in the Console. This will show you the first 10 rows of the data and as many columns as it can fit on the screen. 
  - Type `View(penguins)` at the prompt in the Console to see the data in a spreadsheet type viewer. 

Remember each row is called an observation. How many observations are in this data? 

Who is the individual in this data set? That is, who/what is each observation about? 

Remember, each column is called a variable. Each variable represents a characteristic of the individual. How many variables are in this data set? What are the variable names? 

1.  Pick a single numerical variable and make a histogram of it. Select a reasonable binwidth for it.


2.  Pick a numerical variable and a categorical variable and make a visualization that incorporates both of them. 

3. Pick two numerical variables and a categorical variable and make a visualization that incorporates all of them.


4.  Pick a single categorical variable from the data set and make a bar plot of its distribution.


5.  Pick two categorical variables and make a segmented bar graph to visualize the relationship between the two variables.
